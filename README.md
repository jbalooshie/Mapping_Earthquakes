# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map showing earthquake activity across the world. The Leaflet API was utilized to create the map, and markers and overlays were added using Javascript to visualize the earthquakes. The markers are color coded and scaled based on the magnitude of the earthquake and can be clicked to pull up more specific information about the earthquake magnitude and location. Overlays are available to show major earthquakes and tectonic plates. Earthquake data is provided by the USGS. 

Below is an image of the map with all overlays enabled.
